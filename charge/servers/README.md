# Using AiZynthFinder tools
## Installation
After installing the ChARGe package with options [aizynthfinder], or
[all], run the additional commands to use the AiZynthFinder models.

1.) Install AiZynthFinder with pip.  Make sure not to install the
dependencies, they are locked to a very specific version that is
incompatible with ChARGe.
```
pip3 install --no-deps aizynthfinder reaction-utils
```
